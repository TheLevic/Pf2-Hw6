# Pf2-Hw6
-This is a program that takes in user expression and evaluates, or modifies in whichever way the user wants.
-To get the program up and running you will need to complie hw6.cpp helper/Expression.cpp, and helpers/Token.cpp
-I have not yet implemented variable assignments yet. I was in a time crunch to finish, and wasn't able to figure out how to use maps to do this. Will probably attempt later.
-If you have any questions or feed back feel free to reach out!
